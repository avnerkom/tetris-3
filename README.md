## üí≠ Project Background

This project is a heartfelt tribute to **The New Tetris** from the Nintendo 64‚Äîa game I absolutely loved many years ago. My goal was to recreate the essence of that classic experience and bring it to the modern web, making it accessible to everyone, anywhere, on any device.

### Inspiration & Vision

Using modern web technologies like **Three.js** and **Tone.js**, I've rebuilt the core features that made The New Tetris so memorable:
- ‚úÖ **3D graphics and camera rotation** for that immersive N64 feel
- ‚úÖ **Hold system** to strategically save pieces
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced scoring** with massive multi-line bonuses
- ‚úÖ **Progressive difficulty** with level-based multipliers
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic audio** that adapts to gameplay
- ‚úÖ **Epic celebrations** for high scores and records

### What's Missing (For Now)

While this version captures all the essential gameplay mechanics, some visual flourishes from the original aren't yet implemented:
- The beautiful "skating" animations of new pieces entering from the right side
- Dynamic changing backgrounds as you progress through levels
- Some of the original's visual polish and particle effects

But fear not‚Äî**all the core features that made the game addictive are here!** The spirit of The New Tetris lives on in this accessible, browser-based version that anyone can play without needing an N64 console.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Start (No Installation!)
1. Download `Tetris_final.html`
2. Open in any modern web browser
3. Click "START GAME" and enjoy!

### Firebase Setup (Optional)
To enable cloud high scores:

1. Create a Firebase project at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)
2. Enable Firestore Database
3. Add your config to the file:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    // ... other config
};
```

4. Set Firestore rules:
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/tetris_3d_high_scores/{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Game works perfectly without Firebase using localStorage!

Modify in `CONFIG`:
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    INITIAL_DROP_INTERVAL: 1000,  // Starting speed (ms)
    LEVEL_SPEED_MULTIPLIER: 0.15, // Speed increase per level
    LINES_PER_LEVEL: 10,          // Lines needed to level up
    // ...

```

### Colors
Change piece colors in `COLORS` object:
```javascript
const COLORS = {
    1: '#FF0D72', // T-piece
    2: '#0DC2FF', // I-piece
